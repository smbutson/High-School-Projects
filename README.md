# High-School-Projects
Included are a couple of a projects I worked on in high school. I may include additional projects in the future such as the infamous electric boogaloo multiplayer race. For now though, I have a couple of things presented as is. Here is a simple particle simulator written in C++. It also makes use of SFML 2.1 for the graphics so you will want to have that installed to run the simulator. The tutorial may be of some use in creating your own particle system. Also included is a basic music visualizer that was arose as a modification of a procedural terrain generator we made in processing. I have added a wav file of Africa by Toto to use for testing. Other audio files can be used as well. Make sure you have processing as well as the minim extension downloaded as it performs the fourier transforms needed to convert the sound waves to values which can be assigned to points on a grid.
